About
Abacus is my first robust end-to-end Machien Learning Project. I used scikit-learn to design the ML portion. Using the K-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm and Grid Search, I was able to achieve 97.55% precision after hyperparameter tuning. This model is deployed to Flask where it's connected to a frontend website styled with TailwindCSS.
